# Slice

**Get paid for doing justice.**
Slice is a decentralized dispute resolution network that helps apps settle conflicts and lets people earn rewards by acting as jurors.

Fast, neutral, and on-chain.

## What Is Slice?

Slice is a **decision layer** for the internet.

When two parties disagree, Slice produces a **trustless ruling** that apps and smart contracts can rely on — without holding funds, enforcing logic, or taking sides.

Slice answers one question:

**Who is right?**

---

## Why Slice?

Digital transactions need a way to resolve disputes that is:

* **Neutral** – not controlled by a single platform
* **Fast** – disputes resolved in minutes, not days
* **Scalable** – thousands of jurors available on demand
* **Trustless** – verifiable, on-chain outcomes

Slice is built to make decentralized justice practical at scale.

---

## How It Works

1. An app or contract opens a dispute
2. Slice randomly selects jurors from a staked pool
3. Jurors vote privately
4. Votes are verified and tallied on-chain
5. A final ruling is published
6. The external app executes its own logic

Slice does not move funds or enforce outcomes.
It simply delivers a **credible decision**.

## Earn as a Juror

Anyone can participate as a juror by staking the required token.

As a juror, you:

* Receive disputes while online
* Review clear case summaries
* Vote privately
* Earn rewards for voting with the majority
* Risk penalties for incorrect or missed votes

The system rewards honest judgment and active participation.

---

## Private, Fair Voting

All votes are private until the decision is finalized.

Slice uses a commit–reveal mechanism so that:

* Votes cannot be copied
* Coordination and bribery are harder
* Every ruling is verifiable on-chain

This keeps decisions fair without adding unnecessary complexity.

---

## A Game-Like Experience (With Real Stakes)

Jurors interact through a clean, gamified app:

* Dispute matchmaking
* Timers and notifications
* XP, levels, and reputation
* Token rewards and penalties
* Optional dispute categories

Each dispute is a round.
Your vote is your move.
Predict the majority, earn rewards.

## Built for Apps

Slice is designed to plug into any platform that needs neutral decisions:

* Marketplaces
* Escrow systems
* Freelance platforms
* P2P trading apps
* Games and digital services

Apps open disputes and read rulings.
Slice stays independent.
